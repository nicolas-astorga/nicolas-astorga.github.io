I am a Ph.D. student in the Machine Learning group of **Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar** at the **University of Cambridge**. My research explores **reasoning, Bayesian experimental design, and optimisation** in the context of **large language models (LLMs)**.  
I am supported by a fullyâ€‘funded studentship from the **W.D. Armstrong Trust Fund** (expected graduation 2027).

Previously, I completed a **dual M.Sc.** at the **University of Chile** (Electrical Engineering; Computer Science), with a focus on **Generative Models, Variational Inference, and Information Theory**, ranking **1st/22** in the EE M.Sc. and receiving the **ANID National Masterâ€™s Scholarship** (top ~10%) for the CS M.Sc. I also hold a **B.Sc. Three Major** in Computer, Electrical & Mechanical Engineering and a **P.E. in Electrical Engineering**.
