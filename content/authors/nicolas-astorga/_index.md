I’m a PhD researcher focusing on **enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs via post‑training**. My doctoral work has explored the intersection of LLMs with **Bayesian experimental design** and **optimisation**. My research has appeared in leading venues including **NeurIPS**, **ICML**, **ICLR (Spotlight)**, **ECCV**, and **AISTATS**.
