I am a Ph.D. student in the van der Schaar Lab at the University of Cambridge, where I work with Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar on reasoning, Bayesian experimental design, and optimisation for large language models. My research is supported by a W.D. Armstrong Trust Fund studentship and aims to make adaptive, data-efficient decision-making practical in high-stakes settings.

Before joining Cambridge, I completed a dual M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Chile, where I focused on generative inference models and astronomical object classification. I previously earned a three-major B.Sc. in Computer, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering, as well as the Professional Engineer accreditation in Electrical Engineering.

My work spans probabilistic modelling, variational inference, and large-scale machine learning systems for astronomy and healthcare. I enjoy collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to bring principled ML research into production environments.
