I am a Ph.D. researcher in the Machine Learning and AI lab of Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar at the University of Cambridge. My work studies how large language models can reason about uncertainty, design informative experiments, and optimise decision-making under limited observations. I am particularly interested in coupling Bayesian experimental design with foundation models to build reliable, sample-efficient agents for scientific discovery and human-centred applications.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed dual M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Chile, focusing on generative inference models and the classification of astronomical objects. I also earned a cross-disciplinary B.Sc. spanning computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering, and obtained the Professional Engineer accreditation in Electrical Engineering.

I have deployed production-grade machine learning systems for the ALeRCE astronomy collaboration, developed generative clustering models at Harvard's Institute for Applied Computational Science, and advanced semi-supervised learning methods at the University of Chile's Laboratory of Computational Intelligence.
