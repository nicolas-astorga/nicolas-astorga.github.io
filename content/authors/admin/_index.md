Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge advised by **Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar**. My research explores **reasoning**, **Bayesian experimental design**, and **optimisation** in the context of **LLMs**. Iâ€™m supported by a fullyâ€‘funded **W.D. Armstrong Trust Fund** award (expected graduation **2027**).

Previously, I completed a dual **M.Sc.** in **Electrical Engineering** and **Computer Science** at the **University of Chile**â€”ranked **1st/22** in the EE M.Sc. and awarded the **ANID National Masterâ€™s Scholarship** (top ~10%). I also worked as an **ML Engineer** at **ALeRCE**, contributed to the **ELAsTiCC** challenge, and interned at **Harvard IACS**.
