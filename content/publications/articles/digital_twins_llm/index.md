abstract: |
  We develop a digital-twin framework powered by large language models that assimilates streaming observations, updates latent
  patient states, and recommends interventions in real time. The approach aligns free-form clinical notes with structured models
  to maintain personalised, continually learning digital twins.

summary: LLM-powered digital twins integrate unstructured clinical signals with structured models to deliver adaptive, patient-specific decision support.

The method fuses textual reasoning and probabilistic modelling to keep digital twins synchronised with incoming clinical data,
providing actionable insights for treatment planning.
