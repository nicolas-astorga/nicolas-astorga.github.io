abstract: |
  We design decision-making policies that adaptively acquire patient features before recommending personalised treatments. By
  combining causal representation learning with LLM-guided utility models, the approach tailors information gathering to each
  individual and respects acquisition costs.

summary: Adaptive feature acquisition policies support cost-aware personalised treatment recommendations in clinical settings.

The framework leverages causal structure and language model priors to decide what information to measure for each patient before
selecting treatments, balancing accuracy with acquisition cost.
