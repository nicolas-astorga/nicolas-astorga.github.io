abstract: |
  We augment Bayesian optimisation with the priors and reasoning capabilities of large language models. By translating
  domain knowledge into surrogate model priors and acquisition strategies, the approach accelerates optimisation under
  scarce observations and complex design spaces.

summary: LLM-guided priors and acquisition functions deliver more data-efficient Bayesian optimisation across challenging tasks.

This paper demonstrates how foundation models can guide Bayesian optimisation pipelines, leading to significant gains in sample
and iteration efficiency.
