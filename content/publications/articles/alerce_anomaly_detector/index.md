abstract: |
  This work details the anomaly detection module of the ALeRCE broker, combining deep learning and domain knowledge to
  identify rare astronomical events in real time. The system supports follow-up observations by ranking and prioritising alerts.

summary: The ALeRCE anomaly detector integrates machine learning pipelines that highlight rare astronomical alerts for follow-up.
