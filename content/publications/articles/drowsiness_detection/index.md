abstract: |
  We design a deep learning pipeline that analyses EEG signals to detect operator drowsiness. The model supports safety-critical
  monitoring by providing reliable fatigue assessments.

summary: Deep neural networks trained on EEG enable early detection of drowsiness for safety-critical operations.
