abstract: |
  We describe the architecture, models, and performance of the ALeRCE alert broker that processes alerts from synoptic surveys.
  The system combines machine learning pipelines, active learning, and expert feedback to enable rapid astronomical event
  classification.

summary: Comprehensive overview of the ALeRCE alert broker and its machine learning infrastructure for real-time astronomy.
