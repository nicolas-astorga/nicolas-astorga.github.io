abstract: |
  We introduce ATAT, a transformer architecture that jointly models astronomical time series and contextual tabular metadata.
  The model powers real-time alert classification in synoptic surveys by unifying heterogeneous observational data sources.

summary: ATAT fuses light curves and tabular metadata within a transformer to classify astronomical alerts at scale.
