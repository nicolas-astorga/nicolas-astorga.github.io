abstract: We introduce an LLM-driven pipeline that automatically formulates mathematical optimisation models from natural language specifications, combining reasoning, Bayesian experimental design, and program synthesis to produce verifiable solutions.
summary: LLM-based framework that auto-formulates optimisation models through structured reasoning and verification loops.
