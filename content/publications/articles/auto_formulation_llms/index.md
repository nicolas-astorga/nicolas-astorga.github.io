abstract: |
  We propose an agentic workflow where large language models translate natural-language task descriptions into executable
  mathematical optimisation models. By combining structured prompting, symbolic verification, and Bayesian experimental
  design for query selection, the system iteratively refines candidate formulations and delivers reliable optimisation
  pipelines across diverse domains.

summary: LLM agents that iteratively reason about constraints and objectives can automatically formulate mathematical optimisation models from text.

This work introduces an LLM-driven assistant that constructs optimisation models end-to-end, aligning symbolic reasoning with
structured verification loops to produce trustworthy formulations from informal problem statements.
