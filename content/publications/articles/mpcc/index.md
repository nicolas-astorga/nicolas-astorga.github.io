abstract: |
  MPCC is a hybrid GAN–VAE framework that aligns latent priors with conditional distributions to discover clusters in high-dimensional
  data. The method advances generative clustering for astronomical surveys and other settings with complex latent structure.

summary: A GAN–VAE hybrid that matches priors and conditionals to deliver state-of-the-art clustering performance on astronomical data.

The approach extends BigGAN with variational inference objectives, enabling more structured latent spaces for unsupervised clustering.
