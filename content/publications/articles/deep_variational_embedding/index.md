abstract: |
  We introduce a deep variational embedding architecture tailored to astronomical transient discovery. The model combines
  variational autoencoders with temporal feature learning to cluster light curves, improving early detection of transient events.

summary: Variational embeddings uncover structure in astronomical light curves, supporting automated transient discovery.
