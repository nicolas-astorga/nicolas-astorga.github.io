abstract: |
  We couple large language models with Bayesian experimental design to select observations and interventions under
  partial observability and heterogeneous acquisition costs. The resulting agent reasons over latent task structure,
  chooses informative queries, and delivers superior performance on scientific discovery and decision-making benchmarks.

summary: An active learning framework where LLMs reason about partially observed systems and query costly information through Bayesian experimental design.

The method integrates LLM reasoning with principled query selection, enabling adaptive experimentation in settings where data is
sparse, expensive, or partially observed.
